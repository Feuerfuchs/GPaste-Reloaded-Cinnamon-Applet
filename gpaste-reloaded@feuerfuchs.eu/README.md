This is a completely re-written GPaste applet based on the gnome shell extension. (https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste/tree/master/src/gnome-shell)

GPaste is a clipboard management tool. This applet lets you access your clipboard through an icon in the panel.


# Installation
	
For this applet to work, it is necessary that the GPaste daemon is installed!

To install the applet itself, execute the `install.sh` script. If the applet doesn't appear in the applet list, you should restart Cinnamon by pressing Alt+F2, typing 'r' (without ') and hitting enter.
To remove the applet, just run `install.sh -r`.
