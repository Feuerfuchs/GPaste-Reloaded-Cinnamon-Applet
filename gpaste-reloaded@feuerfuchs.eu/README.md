GPaste is a clipboard management tool. This applet lets you access your clipboard through an icon in the panel.

This is a completely re-written GPaste applet based on the [gnome shell extension](https://github.com/Keruspe/GPaste/tree/master/src/gnome-shell). It offers the following features:
- Search for entries
- Access the native GPaste GUI
- Support for multiple histories
- Manually add entries to the history
- Unlimited instances
